Boilerplate for creating an API using clean architecture.

Using :

- Go
- fiber (v2)
- gorm (PSQL Driver)
- jwt
- validator
- uuid
- godotenv
- logrus
- fiber/swagger
- swaggo/swag

Todo :

- Redis cache
- Websocket on game start
- AWS S3 for images

I used the excellent work of RizkiMufrizal (https://github.com/RizkiMufrizal/gofiber-clean-architecture) but I wanted to rewrite each part to fully understand the structure, the code and adapt it to my needs.
