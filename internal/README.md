# entity

Struct that can be used anywhere in the internal folder
They are are representation of the database, but also the main objets of our application.

# configuration (Todo: merge/refactor config/configuration folders)

config file needed to operate the server/database

# model (Todo: refactor + implement converters)

Represent JSON/Data that the user can send to the API, or receive from the API.
Incoming Data is suffixed with "Input" (ex : CreateUserInput, UpdateUserInput)
Outgoing Data has converters to transform it to entities, or to transform entities to model.

# controller

Controller define routes and handlers. Handlers are used by one route and can use . A Route calls a Handler (return a JSON response) that calls a Service (that return an entity)
The Handler is responsible to decode & validate user input, and transform result from the service to JSON response (using a model)
